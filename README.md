# 2G-Dashboard-Streamlit
A clear and simple dashboard to show many KPIs charts, build using Python, Pandas and Streamlit, the dashboard can read the data from excel file or database and preprocess the data and display the charts, tested on real world data.

To run the code follow the steps:

1. Create the virtual environment in Python. You can name it anything, here we'll use "myenv": 
`virtualenv myenv`

2. Activate the virtual environment:

- On Linux/Mac: 
`source myenv/bin/activate` 
- On Windows:
`myenv\Scripts\activate`

4. Your command prompt will now start with `(myenv)` indicating you are in the virtual environment.

5. To recreate the environment run: 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

6. To deactivate the virtual environment, run:

- On Linux/Mac: 
`deactivate`
- On Windows: 
`deactivate.bat` 

Your command prompt will no longer have `(myenv)`
